# LinkedIn Post - Portfolio Project

## 🚀 Excited to Share My Interactive Portfolio Website!

I'm thrilled to unveil my latest project – a modern, full-stack portfolio that pushes the boundaries of web interactivity! Built as a macOS-inspired desktop experience, it showcases not just my work, but also my passion for cutting-edge web technologies.

## ✨ Technical Highlights

**Three.js at the Core:**
The real star of this project is **Three.js**, which powers multiple immersive 3D experiences:
- 🎨 A custom shader-based particle system with **15,000+ animated particles** that respond to mouse movements, creating a mesmerizing ambient background
- 🧑‍💻 An interactive 3D avatar model with OrbitControls, allowing visitors to rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles
- ⚡ Performance-optimized rendering with device-specific configurations to ensure smooth 60fps across all devices

**Full-Stack Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript, leveraging @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for seamless Three.js integration
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI with GSAP animations
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot with PostgreSQL for robust data management
- **Design:** macOS-style interface with intuitive drag-and-drop interactions

## 🤖 What's Next: AI-Powered Personal Assistant

I recently built an **AI chatbot agent using n8n** that serves as my digital representative – answering questions about my background, skills, and experience. Soon, I'll be integrating this intelligent agent directly into the portfolio, enabling visitors to have natural conversations and get personalized insights about my work!

## 💡 Key Features

✅ Desktop-style file system navigation
✅ Dynamic particle effects with custom GLSL shaders
✅ Responsive design for seamless mobile/desktop experience
✅ Project showcase with detailed case studies
✅ Photography gallery integration
